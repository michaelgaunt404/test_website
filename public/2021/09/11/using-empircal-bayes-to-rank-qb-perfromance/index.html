<p>OMG perfect, its so great! We gain a bit of extra interactivity barely any cost. You can now manipulate the plot area with zoom and drag features and get data attributes with hover-over capability but thatâ€™s about it.</p>
<p>I relied on this workflow for a long time due to its simplicity and to be quite honest I was a bit afraid of the plot syntax. The above example is reproduced below using plotly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>qb_stats_filtered %&gt;%
  mutate(eb_estimate = (Cmp + alpha0) / (Att + alpha0 + beta0)) %&gt;%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(comp_per, eb_estimate)) +
  coord_equal()</code></pre>
