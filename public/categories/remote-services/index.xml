      <description>Welcome!This is the first entry in a larger series of markdowns that I will generate for a project that I am working on.
Together in this blog post, we will learn how to use Amazon S3 to remotely store data (Iâ€™m learning with you too, cool!). I am personally motivated to learn this because I feel that I am very reliant on locally storing my data and feel that this is somewhat a bad habit though everyone does it.</description>
